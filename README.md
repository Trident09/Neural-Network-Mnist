## Introduction
The MNIST dataset is a collection of 70,000 handwritten digits commonly used for training various image processing systems. This project demonstrates how to build and train a neural network to recognize these digits.

## Installation
To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Trident09/Neural-Network-Mnist.git
cd Neural-Network-Mnist
```

## Usage
To train the neural network, run the following command:

```bash
python train.py
```

To evaluate the trained model, use:

```bash
python main.py
```

for testing the model made from scratch check out the `number-recognition-scratch/minst-dataset-model.ipynb`
